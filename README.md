## Project Overview

The **[Meal-Plan]** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the [Introduction to Mobile Application ]
The  application was created using **Kotlin** in  **Android Studio** and we had to incorporate the **If else statement** as part of the assignment 
The app's primary purpose  is to  [ provide meal suggestion  based on time of day for users ]

### Purpose and Features
The application provide users with meal sugggestion for certain time of day , allowing users to have different  meal options throughout the day

### Key Features:
- **Feature 1**: The  App screen provides clear feedback with  minimal effort
- **Feature 1**:The App has maintainable code which involves clear logics and is well structured
- **Feature 1**: The App has a suggestion button which provide users with Meal options and Reset Button allows the input to be cleared
  
### Design Consideration
- **Layout design and Accessibility**: allows users to engage with the app effortlessly with design element such as background image, font and colours which provides the app with a aesthetic 
     appeal
- **Simplicity**: A user-friendly screen designed for easy accessiblity and performance allowing quick response for user input  and providing meal suggestion instantely 
 
### GitHub and GitHub Action Utilisation
The process of incorporating  GitHub version control allowed me to track and manage code changes through commits 
### GitHub Action
Through GitHub Action we perform testing to ensure the app's functionality

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [Login, e.g.implementing a login option  to  verify  the identy of users will allow better data storage.]
2. **Feature 2**: [Cater for different religions, e.g. Broadening the meal optionton to cater for all relgions .]
3. **Feature 3**: [Adding Alarm, e.g., Adding a alarm feature allows users to not miss their meal option that certain time of day .]


## Challenges and Learnings

**Challenge 1**: [I had challeges with the implementation of the If Else statement and understanding how i can incorporate it with the time of day for users  ."]
 **Solution**: [ Through reserach and YouTub I begain to understande the logics of why the assignment usd it insted of other statements ."]
   
 **Challenge 2**: [error handling when running the App for the first time ."]
 **Solution**: [using the school manual and Mr kingcade Garanganga's lecture not allowed me to handle my errors and see where i made mistakes .]
